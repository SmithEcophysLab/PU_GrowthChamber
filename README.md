Data from Purdue growth chamber temperature acclimation experiments

Includes raw ACi data (raw_ACi) and fitted data, plus traits

The project corresponds to the article "Short-term acclimation to warmer temperatures increases leaf carbon exchange processes across plant types" by Smith and Dukes in Global Change Biology.

New (June 2018): This repository now includes data for leaf, stem, and root respiration in the folder Tissue_Respiration.
